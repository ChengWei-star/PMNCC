# PMNCC

Code completion is an efficient software development technique in modern integrated development environments (IDEs), which can predict the most likely code token(s) based on the context of the code to be completed, so as to improve the work efficiency of developers. Li et al. put forward a Pointer Mixture Network has achieved good results in code completion. The contribution of this paper is that we propose PMNCCâ€”a tool based on pointer mixture network for code completion. PMNCC uses one-hot encoding in the data preprocessing phase, which can expand the characteristics of the code. Besides, PMNCC adds label smoothing to avoid the overfitting of neural language networks and improve the generalization ability of the model. In neural language networks, PMNCC applies the three-layer LSTM, so that the hidden layers of LSTM can fully learn the context information. In terms of the optimizer, PMNCC chooses NAdam whose performance is better than Adam used in the pointer mixture network, which greatly accelerates the training speed of the model. Experiments show that our work exceeds the results obtained in the Pointer Mixture Network, which is in code completion tasks in Python and JavaScript programming languages.
